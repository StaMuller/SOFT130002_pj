                <b>Soft Construction with Boiled Beans</b><br>
               Salvidor Dali<br>
               The painting resides at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.<br>
                The painting, which was painted in 1936, is used to show <br>
                the struggle of war that can sometimes be both self-fulfilling<br>
                and self-mutilating at the same time. Despite his support <br>
                of General Franco, Dalí was openly against war, and used <br>
                this painting to show it. <br>

                Vincent Van Gogh<br>
                The Décoration for the Yellow House was the main project <br>
                Vincent van Gogh focused on in Arles, from August 1888 <br>
                until his breakdown the day before Christmas. This Décoration <br>
                had no pre-defined form or size; the central idea of the <br>
                Décoration grew step by step, with the progress of his work. <br>
